            <p class="body-paragraph">I guess we'll start from the vrey beginning. I was born on August 10th 1993 in Bogota, Colombia. Yes, I am aware
            I dont have an accent when I speak english, it is for this reason that I am known as "The Gringo" to all of my
            cousins back in Colombia. I spent the majorty of my infancy in Colombia, spending mmost of my time with my grandparents
            since both of my parents worked. See, the funny thing about latin families is that you never need a nanny. Instead,
            grandparents, aunts, uncles, or godmothers fill the position.</p>
            <P class="body-paragraph">We moved to the states when I was around 5. My father, an electrical engineer, landed a job with an oil and gas company
            in Houston, TX developing software to be implemented in pipeline management and controls. Can never thank him
            enough for working as hard as he did for my mom and I. Adjusting to the US was pretty seamless, and I was able
            to pick up english pretty quick, maybe a little too quick for my moms liking. So much so that when I got home
            from school, my mom, a speech patholgist back in Colombia, would sit me down to practice my spanish. At the time
            I thought it to be the most unecessary chore ever, but now I am very grateful for it, since I was able to retain
            my spanish.....for the most part.</P>
            <p class="body-paragraph">I went on to graduate highschool and attend the University of Texas at Austin (AKA the greatest Univeristy on the
            planet) to pusrue a degree in Electrical Engineering. I had always been interested in science/tech so it wasnt
            a tough decision to go into this field. However, the tough decision came when I had to choose between software
            engineering and power distribution. I ultimately ended up picking the later, and after a couple of years in the
            industry I became more interested in the actual software we were using to deveop electrical layouts/designs than
            the design itself. Hence, I signed up for this bootcamp to see what its all about!</p>
